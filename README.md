# Project Proposal


Ever wanted to go out and meet new people over a casual brunch in a new city? How about wanting to try out the new restaurants around you but none of your friends are available and your social anxiety wonâ€™t let you eat alone? 

Enter MealHub! The best way to munch down your cravings while getting to meet new people. Sign up, enter your preferred cuisine, budget, and availability and let our matching algorithm take care of the rest. Our platform will automatically find a pair/group that matches your preferences, give you a restaurant and time to meet up at, and get to talk to each other on our integrated chatting service.

# Project title

MealHub

# What and why?

MealHub is a web-application that connects people to eateries based on similar interests. This application is meant as a way to meet new people who share YOUR food preferences. 

# For whom?
For individuals who want to meet new people with a shared interest in restaurants, bars, pubs and cafes.

# How?

The goal is to match people on our platform based on similarities and meal preferences. We intend to pair/group individuals using a matching algorithm that allows people to indicate their cuisine of preference, their budget, location, and time availability. Our web app will check for potential restaurants within the common radius of the two potential individuals, and randomly choose one of the restaurants that meet all the preferences. Then, a notification will be pushed to both individuals indicating the exact restaurant and time they have to meet up, along with an integrated chat service between the two for open communication right from our platform.

# Scope

From the high-level concept, the project interface is straightforward enough to build by a team of 4, while the matching algorithms will be challenging enough to take time and effort. This project is similar to a match-based dating application but for food, which would be both a fun and challenging undertaking.
